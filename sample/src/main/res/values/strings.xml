	<string name="location_permission_info">From Android 6.0 Marshmallow onwards the application
        requires Location permission in order to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy devices.\n\nThis
        is because Bluetooth LE beacons, for example iBeacons or Eddystone, may be used to
        determine the phone\'s and user\'s location. <b>Mcu Mgr Sample</b> will not use this
        information in any way.</string>

	<string name="mcumgr_guide_title">CAN\'T SEE YOUR DEVICE?</string>
	<string name="mcumgr_guide_info">1. Make sure the device is <b>turned on</b> and is connected
        to a power source.\n\n2. Make sure the firmware with <b>SMP server</b> is flashed and the
        device is advertising.\n\n3. Check the filter settings. By default, the scanner displays only
        devices that advertise SMP service UUID (8D53DC1D–1DB7–4CD3–868B–8A527460AA84).</string>
	<string name="mcumgr_guide_location_info">3. Location is turned off. Some Android phones
