/**
 * Manages a McuManager firmware upgrade. Once initialized, <b>this object can only perform a single
 * firmware upgrade for a single device to completion</b>. In other words, the same
 * FirmwareUpgradeManager may start the upload, cancel the upload, and call start once again to
 * restart the firmware upgrade. However, once the upload is completed, the same
 * FirmwareUpgradeManager cannot not be used for subsequent firmware upgrades.
 * <p>
 * Like other MCU managers, FirmwareUpgradeManagers must be initialized with a
 * {@link McuMgrTransport} which defines the scheme and implements the transport methods for
 * communicating with the device. FirmwareUpgradeManagers additionally require a callback and
 * the image data to upload.
 * <p>
 * Once initialized, a firmware upgrade is started by calling {@link FirmwareUpgradeManager#start},
 * and can be paused, resumed, and canceled using {@link FirmwareUpgradeManager#pause},
 * {@link FirmwareUpgradeManager#resume}, and {@link FirmwareUpgradeManager#cancel}.
